	^ 'The ChangesBrowser shows you the unsaved changes from your last session. They are grouped into categories on the left side. 
If you click on a change category, the version history of that code is displayed on the right side. You can select any version by clicking on "Choose This Version". 
After you chose a version, all older changes will automatically be loaded into "versions" after loading the changes into the image.
In the window below you can see the difference between the selected version and the current image.
If you are satisfied with your selection, you can load the changes into the image with the button "Load Changes" in the upper right corner.
Warning: With saving and closing the image, your changes won''t be displayed afterwards.'
